# Contributing to Slice-Library

First of all thank you for the interest in contribute to Slice-Library.

## Report a bug

If you encounter a bug I would like to know so, feel free to [create a issue][issues]! But check a few things first:

+ There is not already an open Issue
+ The issue has already been fixed (check the `develop` branch, or look for closed Issues)
+ Is it something really obvious that you can fix yourself?

Please include the following information when filing a bug:

+ CodeIgniter version
+ PHP version
+ A description of the problem
+ Steps to reproduce, if possible

## Suggest a feature

I am a believer of social coding! So, if you have an interesting suggestion to make this code more useful and better I would like to know it. In order to make it easier for me to verify your suggestions, it would be amazing if you could follow these few steps:

+ Fork [the repository][repository] on Github
+ Checkout the `develop` branch
+ Implement your feature with test files to show the feature works as expected
+ Commit the files
+ Send a pull request [(How to send a pull request?)][requests]

It is also important that your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.

## Guidelines

+ Make sure all your PHP code is following the CodeIgniter [Style Guide][styleguide]!
+ Do not use the Issue tracker for personal support requests
+ Do not derail or troll issues
+ Pease keep the discusion on topic and respect the opinions of others
+ Search previous suggestions before making a new one (avoid being a duplicate)
+ Suggestions must be tested and documented
+ Keep description short and simple, but descriptive
+ Check your spelling and grammar
